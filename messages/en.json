    "history": "My name is Pau, and I was born in 1998 in Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain. A few years ago, I began a higher education degree in IT, where I discovered my true passion: programming and web development. After finishing the degree, I decided to continue my education and started an online bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at UOC. Currently, I am balancing my work as a front-end developer with my university studies, without any issues.",
    "history2": "I have had the opportunity to work on projects that allowed me to apply and refine my skills in front-end development. One of the achievements I am most proud of is my participation in the Aprobatus project, a project built from scratch where we managed to get over 17,000 web contact requests in less than a year.",
